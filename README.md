just simple script esp for roblox game die of death 
Honestly, I wrote it with DeepSeek. But it works great. I'll list what it can do: shows survivors in invisibility, indicates how much HP survivors have, does not show ghosts, shows computers created by badware, shows killer. The script indicates the killer in red, computers in yellow, and survivors in green.
